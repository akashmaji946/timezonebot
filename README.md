# timezonebot
Simple text-based Chatbot application that returns time zone of a few cities [Python/RASA] 

It is a simple command line interpreter based application that return the time zone of the asked city.
Although the present app returns the time-zone of only a few cities, but this app can be extended to store the city names and theit time zones.

## Tools used
- Python core interpreter
- RASA library
- Data set
